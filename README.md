# 👋 Greatings!
My name is @michaelbitton and this is my new GitHub main repository. I am new to GitHub (8/23/2023). I just found a cool lecture on customizing my main repository's README.md file. Markdown is new to me but seems very easy to learn. I have no content just yet but that will change in the next few days. I have several projects in mind that I am eager to start. First will be Java, SQL, and Python courses for learning new core skills. After that I wish to start a "Writer's Editor" since I am slowly writing a novel.  As I write, I have discovered plenty of ideas for my feature wishlist I want to include in the editor so I am excited to get started.

## Expanding My Core Skills
- [X] 🌱 (started) --I’m currently learning **Java** from a great course utilizing the community edition of the **IntelliJ** IDE from [JetBrains.com](https://www.jetbrains.com/) on [Udemy.com](https://www.udemy.com/).
	- [ ] After Java, it may be prudent to learn **"Microservices Architecture on AWS."**  I hope I'll be able to fit this into my schedule right after the Java course is complete.
- [ ] 🌱 My initial exposure to **Python** was in self-discovery mode for a *CI/CD* project I was assigned in mid-2022. I realize there is a lot more to Python than I was able to discover on my own, so my next online course will be targeted to expand that knowledge. The community edition of **PyCharm** from [JetBrains.com](https://www.jetbrains.com/) will be my IDE of choice.
- [ ] 🌱 Finally, I learned a lot of **SQL** many years ago and have used some standard *SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements* in projects in recent years, but the majority of what I learned has been unused and forgotten. Again I have an online course from [Udemy.com](https://www.udemy.com/) selected to increase my core skills.  The course I have selected uses PostgreSQL.
- [ ] 🌱 As an additional note, I have decided to take a refresher course on **HTML, CSS and Javascript**. I have noticed a huge number of job postings that require these basic skills, so I thought I'd better get a **LOT more practice**. There is an extensive bootcamp course on [Udemy.com](https://www.udemy.com/) that I am ready to jump into at any time.

## Upcoming Project(s)
The Editor project will be ambitious but I have found some projects on the [codeproject.com](https://www.codeproject.com) and other `code writer's forums` that have parts of features that I will need, however, none of them are written in Java.  I plan to translate and update the project using *Clean Code* and *SOLID* principles as I have found not all programmers are as careful as I want to be.
- [ ] Writer's Editor Features:
  - Full RTF capable editor
  - Encodeable/decodeable file and data storage.
  - Spell Checker -- I haven't decided whether to use a 3rd-party dictionary or generate the dictionary.
  - Quick Jump Outline designer -- clickable outline heirarchy quickly jumps to the last edit position in each chapter.
  	- Edit mode to define the *book outline via template*
   	- Edit mode to manage *section/chapter names*
  - Quick Style Insertion panes for commonly used names, chapter titles, dividers, art clips etc.
	- Search / Replace updates styles on the fly
  - Secure Cloud Project Storage that is configurable to each author's needs.
