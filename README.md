👋 Greatings everyone!

My name is @michaelbitton and this is my new GitHub repository.  I am new to GitHub (8/23/2023) and just found a cool lecture on customizing repositories. I have no content just yet but I have several projects in mind that I am eager to start.  First will be some Java, SQL, and Python learning projects.  After that I wish to start a "Writer's Editor" since I am slowly writing a novel.  As I write, I have discovered plenty tasks for my feature wishlist I want to include in the editor so I am excited to get started.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java from a great course (so far!) on Udemy.com
- 🌱 My initial exposure to Python was in self-discovery mode for a CI/CD project I was assigned in mid-2022. I realize there is a lot more to python than I was able to discover on my own, so my next online course will be targeted to expand that knowledge.
- 🌱 Finally, I learned some SQL basics many years ago and have used some standard SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements in projects over more recent years, but the majority of what I learned has been unused and forgotten. Again I have an online course from Udemy.com selected to increase my core skills.
