- 👋 Greatings everyone!
-
- My name is @michaelbitton and this is my new GitHub repository.  I am new to GitHub (8/23/2023) and just found a cool lecture on customizing repositories. I have no content just yet but I have several projects in mind that I am eager to start.  First will be some Java, SQL, and Python learning projects.  After that I wish to start a "Writer's Editor" since I am slowly writing a novel.  I have plenty of ideas I want to include in the editor so I am excited to get started.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java from a great course (so far!) on Udemy.com
